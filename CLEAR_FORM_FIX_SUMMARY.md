# 🔄 **Clear Form Fix: Preserve Partner Information**

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

**Problem**: The "Clear Form" button was clearing all fields including the partner information (Partner ID, Partner Name, Case Manager Email, Case Manager Phone), which should remain populated after a successful partner lookup.

**Solution**: Modified the `handleClear` function to preserve partner information while only clearing the request submission fields.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **Updated `handleClear` Function (`public/src/components/request-form.tsx`)**

#### **Before (Problematic)**
```typescript
const handleClear = () => {
  setFormData({
    ...formData,
    caseManagerEmail: '',        // ❌ Cleared partner info
    caseManagerPhone: '',        // ❌ Cleared partner info
    description: '',
    recipientsName: '',
    // ... other fields cleared
  });
  onClearForm();
};
```

#### **After (Fixed)**
```typescript
const handleClear = () => {
  setFormData({
    ...formData,
    // ✅ Preserve partner information (auto-filled from partner lookup)
    partnerId: partner.id,
    partnerName: partner.partnerName,
    caseManagerEmail: partner.caseManagerEmail,
    caseManagerPhone: partner.caseManagerPhone,
    // ✅ Clear only the request submission fields
    description: '',
    recipientsName: '',
    recipientsStreetAddress: '',
    recipientsCity: '',
    recipientsState: '',
    recipientsZip: '',
    recipientsEmail: '',
    recipientsPhone: '',
    numberOfMenInHousehold: '',
    numberOfWomenInHousehold: '',
    numberOfChildrenInHousehold: '',
    descriptionOfNeed: '',
  });
  onClearForm();
};
```

### **Updated `handleSubmit` Reset Logic**

#### **Before (Inconsistent)**
```typescript
// Reset form data
setFormData({
  ...formData,
  caseManagerEmail: '',        // ❌ Cleared partner info
  caseManagerPhone: '',        // ❌ Cleared partner info
  // ... other fields cleared
});
```

#### **After (Consistent)**
```typescript
// Reset form data - preserve partner information
setFormData({
  ...formData,
  // ✅ Preserve partner information (auto-filled from partner lookup)
  partnerId: partner.id,
  partnerName: partner.partnerName,
  caseManagerEmail: partner.caseManagerEmail,
  caseManagerPhone: partner.caseManagerPhone,
  // ✅ Clear only the request submission fields
  description: '',
  // ... other request fields cleared
});
```

## 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

### **✅ Before Clear Form**
1. **Partner Information Section** (Preserved):
   - Partner ID: `1234` ✅
   - Partner Name: `Test Partner` ✅
   - Case Manager Email: `manager@test.com` ✅
   - Case Manager Phone: `555-123-4567` ✅

   - Recipient Information: `John Doe, etc.` ❌
   - Household Information: `2 men, 3 women, 4 children` ❌

### **✅ After Clear Form**

   - Partner ID: `1234` ✅
   - Partner Name: `Test Partner` ✅
   - Case Manager Email: `manager@test.com` ✅
   - Case Manager Phone: `555-123-4567` ✅

2. **Request Details Section** (Cleared):
