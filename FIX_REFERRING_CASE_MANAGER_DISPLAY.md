# 🔧 Fixed: "Referring Case Manager" Display Issue

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The "Referring Case Manager" field was still being displayed on the main page even though it was removed from the database and other components. This has now been fixed.

**Current Deployment URL:** https://2b8d3f4e.partner-request-portal.pages.dev

## 🐛 **Issue Description**

After removing the "Referring Case Manager" field from the database and most components, the field was still appearing on the main partner portal page in the partner information section, showing as blank since the data no longer existed.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**

Two components were still referencing the old `Partner` interface that included the `referringCaseManager` field:

1. **`PartnerLookup` component** - Still had the old interface definition
2. **`PartnerPortal` page** - Still had the old interface and was displaying the field

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **PartnerLookup Component (`public/src/components/partner-lookup.tsx`)**
- ✅ **Updated Partner interface** - Removed `referringCaseManager` field
- ✅ **Cleaned up interface** - Now matches the updated database schema

### **PartnerPortal Page (`public/src/pages/partner-portal.tsx`)**
- ✅ **Updated Partner interface** - Removed `referringCaseManager` field
- ✅ **Removed display field** - Removed the "Referring Case Manager" card from the partner information grid
- ✅ **Updated grid layout** - Changed from `md:grid-cols-2` to `md:grid-cols-3` for better spacing with 3 remaining fields

## 🎯 **Current Partner Information Display**

### **Main Page Partner Information**
The partner information section now displays only:

1. **Partner Name** - Blue card with building icon
2. **Email Address** - Green card with mail icon  
3. **Phone Number** - Orange card with phone icon

### **Layout**
- ✅ **3-column grid** - Better spacing and visual balance
- ✅ **Consistent styling** - Each field has its own colored card
- ✅ **Clean interface** - No more blank "Referring Case Manager" field

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Step 1: Test Partner Lookup**
1. **Visit**: https://2b8d3f4e.partner-request-portal.pages.dev
2. **Enter partner ID**: `1234`
3. **Click "Go"** or press Enter
4. **Verify partner information** - Should show only Partner Name, Email Address, and Phone Number
5. **Confirm** - No "Referring Case Manager" field should appear

### **Step 2: Test Request Form**
1. **After partner lookup**, the request form should appear
2. **Check partner information section** - Should show only the 3 remaining fields
3. **Submit a request** - Verify all data saves correctly

### **Step 3: Test Admin Panel**
1. **Visit**: https://2b8d3f4e.partner-request-portal.pages.dev/admin
